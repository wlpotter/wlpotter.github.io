<div class="about-me">
<p>I'm an archivist and student of Mediterranean and west Asian cultures in late antiquity. Through my graduate training in these areas, I have come to appreciate the crucial roles libraries and archives play for human knowledge. For this reason I am pursuing a career in library and information science.</p>

<p>Most of my research and work has been on Syriac language and cultural heritage. These projects are vital for the Syriac heritage communities which exist in a global diaspora but are threatened by continuing violence in western and central Asia. These experiences have instilled in me the conviction to build accessible, user-oriented digital cultural heritage archives.</p>

<p>As I've grown as an archivist and developer, I've learned that usability stems from clear, maintainable information architecture and program design.</p>

## What I've been working on


<!-- this can be made into an include I believe. We need a data page that lists the following for ea project:

- name
- page-url (url of the project page)
- thumbnail (path-to-thumbnail)
- feature (yes/no -- this will toggle it on the homepage or not)
- codebase-url
- live-demo-url
- description (a one-two sentence blurb; this is in place of the bulleted list onc eyou have pages for ea)
- tags (this would be an array of key words, eventually...)
