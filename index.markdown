<div class="about-me">
<p>I'm an archivist and student of Mediterranean and west Asian cultures in late antiquity. Through my graduate training in these areas, I have come to appreciate the crucial roles libraries and archives play for human knowledge. For this reason I am pursuing a career in library and information science.</p>


<p>Most of my [research](<!--link to research/index-->) and [work](<!-- link to project page (eventually with facet for Syriac)-->) has been on Syriac language and cultural heritage. These projects are vital for the Syriac heritage communities which exist in a global diaspora but are threatened by continuing violence in western and central Asia. These experiences have instilled in me the conviction to build accessible, user-oriented digital cultural heritage archives.</p>


<p>As I've grown as an archivist and developer, I've learned that usability stems from clear, maintainable information architecture and program design.</p>
